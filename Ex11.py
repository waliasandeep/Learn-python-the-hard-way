#Exercise 11
#Taking basic inputs from the user
print "How old are you?"
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?"
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?"
weight=raw_input()

print "So you are %r years old,%r tall and %r heavy." %(age,
 height, weight)

#Skipping excersice 12 as it is making you do the same difference
#being age = raw_input("How old are you")
# another useful thing to learn from this excersice is 
#-m pydoc raw_input which will show us what raw_input does
